# Abstract

Last years, human population has been growing exponentially. Projections of population growth established in 2017 predict that the human population is likely to keep growing until 2100,[https://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/] reaching an estimated 8.6 billion in 2030, 9.8 billion in 2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100. While the earth gets more crowded, we have to ask the question how we will feed all those people. The Global Food & Agriculture Statistics dataset, provided by the UN, grants over 3 million time-series and cross sectional data relating to food and agriculture. In our project, we will search for the most efficient ways of providing food to humans, in terms of health, environmental impact, area use,... Our story will start with looking at the global factors and current situation. Later we will zoom in on the United States, and look how they could transform their food industry to be as efficient as possible.

# Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.

* How does agriculture affects the greenhouse gas emission ? (Which product emits the most greenhouse gas)
* How much are the different countries self sufficient in terms of agricultural products ? And how does that impact the food security, GDP, economic growth, population growth, population alimentation,etc?
* How replacing a part of meat (and milk, dairy products) production by the production of vegetal sources of proteins could change the impact of agriculture on environment (GHG emissions, land use, water use,...)?
* How does the country agricultural products influences the alimentation of the people in this country?
* Studying the agricultural products exchanges and the dependancy of country to other countries for agricultural products.
* How does the use of machinery, fertilizer and pesticides relate to yields per area unit?
* How can we classify agricultural products according to their impact on environment? Which parameters are significant?
* What if we take into account geographical parameter? Does the transport of those products change the ranking?
* What is the link between import/export and a country security of supply?

# Dataset
