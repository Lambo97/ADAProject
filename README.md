# Abstract

Last years, human population has been growing exponentially. Projections of population growth established in 2017 predict that the human population is likely to keep growing until 2100, [https://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/] reaching an estimated 8.6 billion in 2030, 9.8 billion in 2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100. While the earth gets more crowded, we have to ask the question how we will feed all those people. The Global Food & Agriculture Statistics dataset, provided by the UN, grants over 3 million time-series and cross sectional data relating to food and agriculture. In our project, we will search for the most efficient ways of providing food to humans, in terms of health, environmental impact, area use,... Our story will start with looking at the global factors and current situation. Later we will zoom in on the United States, and look how they could transform their food industry to be as efficient as possible.

# Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.

* How does agriculture affects the greenhouse gas emission ? (Which product emits the most greenhouse gas)
* How can we classify agricultural products according to their impact on environment? Which parameters are significant?
* What if we take into account geographical parameter? Does the transport of those products change the ranking?
* How replacing a part of meat (and milk, dairy products) production by the production of vegetal sources of proteins could change the impact of agriculture on environment (GHG emissions, land use, water use,...)?
* How does the consumtion of certain agricultural products influences the health of the people in this country?
* How can countries transform their agriculture to be as efficient as possible

# Dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

From the UN global food and agriculture statistics, we will use :
 * All the datasets beginning with Emissions
 * All the datasets beginning with Environment
 * The 2 "CommodityBalances" files
 * The 2 "FoodSupply" files
 * "Indicators_from_Household_Surveys_E_All_Data_(Normalized)"
 * All the datasets beginning with Inputs
 * "Investment_Machinery_E_All_Data"
 * "Macro-Statistics_Key_Indicators_E_All_Data_(Normalized)"
 * "Population_E_All_Data_(Norm)"
 * All the datasets beginning with Production
 

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
Add here a sketch of your planning for the next project milestone.

* Data acquisition :
  * Select the csv file that fits with our research questions
  
* Data cleaning :
  * Make element/item to column
  * Check the flags of each data
  * Outliers detection
  
* First analysis
 * Making a first simple analysis : link between agricultural product and GHG emissions.
 * Come back on research question and precise them according to what we have done so far
